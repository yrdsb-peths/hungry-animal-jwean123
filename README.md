WHAT THE GAME IS ABOUT:

- You are playing as the hungry dolphin
- The dolphin's objective is to catch bread falling into the ocean
- Every bread you catch adds one to the score, every bread you fail to catch results in losing one life
- Every 5 score you get, the speed of the dolphin and the bread falling both increase by 1
- Try to survive as long as you can!
